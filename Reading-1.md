# Component-Based Architecture


 

> A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

## charactistics of a component

Reusability −  reused in different situations

Replaceable −. freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces

Independent −  designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

##  advantages of using component based architecture 

- Ease of deployment 
- Reduced cost 
- Ease of development  
- Reusable 
- Modification of technical complexity  
- Reliability 
- System maintenance and evolution  
- Independent

### What is props short for

“Props” :
- is a special keyword in React
- stands for properties 
- being used for passing data from one component to another.


### Using Props in React
1. define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. render the Props Data



## flow of props -> can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child)
