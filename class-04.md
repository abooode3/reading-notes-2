LINKS-->

we use links in HTML there is a many types of links and many uses for example: links from one website to another, from one page to another in the same website, or links open in a new browser window ... etc 

To insert link in HTML pages we used  (a Opening and Colsing Tag) < a > link text</ a>, with < a > elemnt used attribute called ( href ) to insert the URL.
- we can use another attributes with < a > tag like (mailto, target ... )

LAYOUTS-->
positioning elements -> in css each html element is like a box
(block-level box or inline box),

block-level: start on a new line/ act as the main building blocks of any layout (h1 /p /ul /li )

inline boxes: flow between surrounding text/ cam control space of each box takes by width and hight.(img/ b / i)
To separate boxes we use margain/ padding/ border..etc

contaning elements: group a number of element togather inside < div >.

we can controlling the position of element using position schema : 
1) normal flow     2)relative positioning   3)absolute positioning

to know where a box should be positioned use box offset properites (how far from top, bottom, left, right)
wh have 1)fixed position 2)floating element 
- with position we can use many properites(static, relative, absolurte, fixed..)

when you create your website you should consider there is a many visitors used a different sized screens (design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.), also the screen resolution some screen have a higher resolution than other and page size so for this, 
*designed a fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of thir browser
 *also liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of thir browser 
** use grids to create professional and flexible designs.

FUNCTION , METHODS AND OBJECTS -->
-function: is a series of statment togather to perfom a specific task.
syntax: Declaring the function 
function functionName ( parameter ){
   code to excute
** we should have a return inside the code to return the value of the function 
}

if we want to use a funtion after we declare it , should Calling the functon -->  functionName(); 
**if the function take a parameter 
when calling the funtion should send something called arguments 
** when declared a variable inside function you should use it just inside the finction this is called local scope .

Pair Programming
--> practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
pair programming commonly involves two roles 
1) driver:programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard
2) navigator: thinks about the big picture, what comes next

pair program is useful in many ways 1) Greater efficiency 2) Engaged collaboration 3) Learning from fellow students 4)Social skills 5) Job interview readiness 6)Work environment readiness
