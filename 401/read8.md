#### SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

- SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design

* SOLID stands for:

- S - Single-responsiblity Principle
- O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle

- Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
* hat the class or module should have only one reason to change.


- Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:
> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* hould be open for extension, but closed for modification.
*  have a switch statement somewhere that you needed to go in and add to every time you wanted to add a menu option to your application.


- Liskov Substitution Principle states:
> This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

- Interface segregation principle states:
> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

- Dependency inversion principle states:
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
