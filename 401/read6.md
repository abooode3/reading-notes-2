#### Object

- bjects are key to understanding object-oriented technology.
- objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior
- An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and  exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).
- Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:
- Modularity
- Information-hiding
- Code re-use
- Pluggability and debugging ease


#### Class
- A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

#### Inheritance
- Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.

- In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.



#### Interfaces
- An interface declaration can contain method signatures, default methods, static methods and constant definitions. The only methods that have implementations are default and static methods.

#### Package
- A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.
- Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage.
- The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications.
