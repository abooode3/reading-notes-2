## Linked Lists

- A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each othe, ach Node references the next Node in the link.

- There are two types of Linked List 
1. Singly : refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

2. Doubly : refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.


#### Traversal
-  depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing


#### What’s a Linked List, Anyway?

* linear data structures

- linear data structures: which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.
- non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

* Memory management
- Array: When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory
       - arrays are static data structures

- Linked list : Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.
       - lists are dynamic data structures.


#### what even is Big O?
> One way to think about Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

#### To list or not to list?
* a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
