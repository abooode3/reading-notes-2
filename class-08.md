## positioning elements 
 in css each html element is like a box(block-level box or inline box),

* block-level: 
start on a new line/ act as the main building blocks of any layout (h1 /p /ul /li )

* inline boxes: 
flow between surrounding text/ cam control space of each box takes by width and hight.(img/ b / i)
To separate boxes we use margain/ padding/ border..etc

* contaning elements:
 group a number of element togather inside < div >.

we can controlling the position of element using position schema : 
1. normal flow 
 2. relative positioning 
 3. absolute positioning

to know where a box should be positioned use box offset properites (how far from top, bottom, left, right)
we have:
 1. fixed position 
 2. floating element 
* with position we can use many properites(static, relative, absolurte, fixed..)

when you create your website you should consider there is a many visitors used a different sized screens (design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.), also the screen resolution some screen have a higher resolution than other and page size so for this, 
- designed a fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of thir browser
- also liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of thir browser 
-  use grids to create professional and flexible designs.
