LISTS-->

in HTML we have many types of list:
1) ordered list -> each item in list is numbered .
2) unorders list -> list begin with a bullet point .
3) definition list.

we using < ul > tag its refer to unordered list, also used < ol > its for ordered list and < li > tag refer to list item. 
**list can be nestted 
** also use another tags to define list such as < d1 > < dd > < dt > 


BOXES --> 
CSS treats HTML element as it is a boxes, so each box hava dimensions like (width, hight),
and also use border , margin and padding. 

*the border how is the separates the edge of one box from another. and have some property like 
(border width, border color, border style.. etc )

*margin sit outside the edge of the border.
(can add margin from top/ right/ bottom/ left)

*padding is the space between the border of box and any content contained within it.
(can add padding from top/ right/ bottom/ left)

*(and we use padding and margin to adding space between various items on the page)

can add some property to change display (inline/ block/ none .. etc) and ability to hide a boxes using visible or hide.. and so on. 

ARRAYS -->

it's a special type of variable and can store a list of values.
syntax-> var arrayName = [values]; 
**each item in the array take a number called (index), if you want to access item or retreve item through index. 
 
SWITCH STATMENT-->

switch loop :  it's include many cases, each case include some code to execute if there is a match between case and what user input, and we use break to get out of the case when it execute, and the last thing put default case, this case will excute when there is no match between what user input and cases 

 A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that valu.

LOOPS--> 

loops check a condition if it returns true, a code block will run. then condition will cheched again and if it still true the code block will run again , until the comdition return false 

common types of loops=> For, While And Do while
 
For-> use to run code a specific number of times, the condition is a counter to tell how many times the loop should run
syntax:
For (Condition) {
code to excute during loop
}
the condiction have (initialization value, condition and update)

While-> use it when the times  the code should run does'nt matter, condition something other than a counter. the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition true 

- the first statement uses the+= operator, which is used to add new content to the msg variable.
- The second statement increments the counter variable 
- When the loop has finished, the interpreter goes to the next line of code
