virsion control -> 

version control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes and compare them, in a local version control 

there are many types of version control like:

1- local version control (vcs) 
2- centralized version control system 
3- distributed version control system (dvcs) 

Git-->  is a DVCS (distributed version control system ) thats mean you can store data in a file system made up of snapshots and store a reference to it.

files in git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

-> committed : data stored in local database

 -> modified : changed happened but still not committed to database.
-> staged  : flaged a file changed version to committed it in next snapshot .

**git use remote repositories and that allows the team to push informations and pull date from the repositories
