# LOCAL STORAGE

* cookies use for persistent local storage of small amounts of data:

- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, so it's slowing down web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
-  sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data

What we really want is:
- a lot of storage space
- on the client
- that persists beyond a page refresh
- and isnâ€™t transmitted to the server

 to check for HTML5 Storage:
>
function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}


HTML5-> based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key.
