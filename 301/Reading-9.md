# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING


- What is functional programming?
the prosses of building elemnt by using pure fuctions the functional programming structure is abuot function call another
- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
functions that accept an input and returns a value without modifying any data outside its scope.
- What are the benefits of a pure function?
The function return values are identical for identical arguments. The function application has no side effects. Thus a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function
- What is immutability?
not capable of or susceptible to change
- What is Referential transparency?
In functional programming, referential transparency is generally defined as the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value) without changing the result of the program
- What is a module?
Modular programming is the process of subdividing a computer program into separate sub-programs. A module is a separate software component. It can often be used in a variety of applications and functions with other components of the system.
- What do we have to do to make a module available?
module.exporrts = name of the function
- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
name of the function =require('path')
- What does the word ‘require’ do?
import data 'funtion'
