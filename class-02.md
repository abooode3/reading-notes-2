JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS

syntax-> var  variable name = value;

Expressions evaluate into a single value and relay on operators to calculate a value (arithmetic operators, string operators)

LOOPS-->
switch loop : use to present the user with a different message depending on which level they are at. The message is stored in a variable called msg. 

--> A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value
