## **GROWTH MINDSET**
In the world of Albert Einstein:
>Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different RESULTS.
 
Growth mindset -> Is that everything can become possible through effort, perseverance and learning, and this will enable you to achieve more goals, on other words no matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.

#### Always make sure to remind myself that
- *All things are difficult before they are easy*
- *It's never too late*
- *Success is a choice*
