Comparrison Operators=>

evaluate a sitiation by comparing one value in the script to what expect it might be, Result-> 1) TRUE  OR/ 2)FALSE 

copmarision operators -> (==/!=/===/!==/>/</<=/>=)

1)Equal to (==)-> use to compare two values the result will be TRUE they are the same, if they not the result will be FALSE 

2)Strict equal to(===)-> use to compare two values if they are have the same data type and same value 

3) Is  not equal to(!=)-> use to compare two values if they are not the same 

4) Strict not equal to (!==)->use to compare two values if  thery are not the same data type and same value 

5) Greater than (>)-> comare between two value and  checks if the number on the left is grater than number on the right  

6) Less than(<)-> comare between two value and  checks if the number on the left is less than number on the right  

7) Grater than or equal to (>=)-> use to checks if the number on the left is grater than or equal number on the right  

8) Less than or equal to (<=)-> use to checks if the number on the left is less than or equal number on the right 
There are also many more operators to compare the result: logical operators:


Logical Operatio=>
1) && -> testes more than one condition 
if both expression evalute to true return TRUE
if just one of expression return false then return FALSE

2) || -> testes at least one condition 
if either expression evaluates to true then the expression return true 
if both return false then return false

3) ! ->this operation takes a single boolean value and inverts it
!true -> false
!false ->true

LOOPS=>

loops check a condition if it returns true, a code block will run. then condition will cheched again and if it still true the code block will run again , until the comdition return false 

common types of loops=> For, While And Do while
 
For-> use to run code a specific number of times, the condition is a counter to tell how many times the loop should run
syntax:
For (Condition) {
code to excute during loop
}
the condiction have (initialization value, condition and update)

While-> use it when the times  the code should run does'nt matter, condition something other than a counter. the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition true 

- the first statement uses the+= operator, which is used to add new content to the msg variable.
- The second statement increments the counter variable 
- When the loop has finished, the interpreter goes to the next line of code
